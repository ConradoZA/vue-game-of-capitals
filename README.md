# Game of Capitals

A simple game where you have to place a mark on the map where you think is one of the capital cities of the world.

A frontend only project; it makes only one call to a public API (thanks [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/#about-this-project)!) on the initial load and that's it.

It's SPA, there is no navigation so no router needed.

- Vue 3.4
- Pinia 2.1
